            <p>I am Jotish Chandra Sarker. My goal is to be a decent developer in IT sector. To achieve my goal I am working hard on it. Everyday I spent some quality time to code. As a job holder I know it will be hard but no matter what I will try my best. At lest 4 hours in a day I do practice hard for my goal. In extra time I try to read documentation and articles. When assignment comes I think I can learn more because every problems when I search I can find more topics to discover. In one year I want to see myself in a good shape.</p>
